This generates spectrogram from images.
Sound spectrogram are a type of graph used in sound engineering to represent the "signature" of a sound. 

They are the representation of the frequencies heard by unit of time. The frequency strengh is denoted by the colour of
the graph at that point.
Therefore, **it is possible to generates a soundwave such that its spectrogram would represent an images**. 
This is the aim of this project.
Example of normal sound spectrogram:

I did two versions: 

## Why is this called V2
This repo is called V2 and is different [from this other one](https://github.com/sam1902/SpectroGen) because this 
version is to be more professional and usable in another project.
